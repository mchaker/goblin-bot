## Real-time chat context detection

Detect shitposting, chat topic of discussion, and general attitude or "heat
level" in a chat, in real time. Show status on a webpage. Make data available 
via API. Use TensorFlow. Incorporate an FPGA.

Abstract the message stream/handler -- allow for "plugins" (backend handlers) to
interop with multiple different chat services
