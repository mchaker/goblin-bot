## Real-time chat context detection

Detect shitposting, chat topic of discussion, and general attitude or "heat
level" in a chat, in real time. Show status on a webpage. Make data available 
via API. Use TensorFlow. Incorporate an FPGA.

Abstract the message stream/handler -- allow for "plugins" (backend handlers) to
interop with multiple different chat services

Git workflow:
- make a work branch for work (/users/githubusername/branchname)
- make changes in that branch
- PR from that branch to master
- delete work branch
- one branch per feature/task/"deliverable"
